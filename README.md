# MLP for Solving Ordinary & Partial Differential Equations

#### Adapted from the seminal "Artificial Neural Networks for Solving Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations" 

- A project built for a client to solve ordinary and partial differential equations semi-analytically using a multi-layer perceptron neural network (simple feed-forward or "vanilla" neural network).
- Implemented using the Keras Subclassing API.
